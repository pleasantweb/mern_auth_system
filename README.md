I have implemented auth system in MERN website.
I have used Express JS in Backend, Next JS in Frontend, and MongoDB as database.
A 5 digit confirmation code will be sent to user email when he/she register.
This code will be valid for 2 minutes. After that, User can ask for another code by clicking resend code button.
User cannot log in until he/she activate his account.
Access and Refresh token will be generated by JWT.
Only Refresh Token will be saved inside httpOnly cookie and
Access token will only be access in frontend state which only work for few minutes or when user refreshes the page.
Then, from Refresh Token, another Access Token will be generated automatically.
And User will continue to logged in until the Refresh Token cookie expires or User delete it.
